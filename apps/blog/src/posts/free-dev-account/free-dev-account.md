# Free Developer Accounts for Publishing PWAs to the Microsoft Store on Windows

We are excited to announce a new program to empower PWA developers to bring their ideas and experiences to Windows, for FREE. For a limited time, in partnership with the Microsoft Store, Microsoft Store developer account tokens will be available (approximate value $20 each) to developers that own qualifying PWAs and wish to make those available to Windows users via the Microsoft Store. Just enter your PWA url [here](#) to get started.

## Why Publish your PWA to the Microsoft Store?

PWAs are first class applications on Windows and can be indistinguishable from apps built with native technology. In addition, the Microsoft Store is available to over one billion users on Windows 10 and 11, offering a huge reach and potential audience for your apps on Windows. By packaging and publishing your PWA to the Microsoft Store, you can increase the discoverability of your app and broaden your user base. Additionally, the Microsoft Store provides a trusted platform for users to find and install apps, giving your PWA more credibility and visibility.

## How Does it Work?

To qualify for a free developer account, your PWA must meet our quality standards. We define the requirements for a high-quality PWA, including: 

- Your PWA is installable from the browser, 
- Your web manifest has all required fields that describe and define your PWA, and
- You have implemented two or more desktop integrations like shortcuts or Window controls overlay. 

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that your PWA delivers great user experience across different devices and platforms. 

Once your PWA meets the quality criteria, we will provide you with a token to create a free developer account. This token eliminates the (approximately) $19 account registration fee, making it more accessible for developers to publish their apps.

## How to Get Started?

To participate in this limited-time offer, simply enter your PWA URL [here](#) for evaluation using our qualification flow. Once your PWA qualifies, you will need to sign in with a Microsoft Account to claim your token.

If your PWA qualifies, you will get a token to create a free developer account on the Microsoft Store. Our documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to create your account and publish your PWA to the Microsoft Store.

Take this opportunity to showcase your PWA to a wider audience and leverage the benefits of the Microsoft Store. [Start the process now](#).
