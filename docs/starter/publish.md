# Publishing Your PWA

Once you've developed your PWA using the starter, it's time to publish your application to the web. 
This not only makes your PWA available through the browser, but also allows you to package your application for different app stores with <a href=#/builder/quick-start>PWABuilder.</a>

For now, we only have guidance for publishing with Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Pages, but will be adding additional routes in the future.

## Azure Static Web Apps

One option for deploying your PWA is Azure Static Web Apps, and can be set up in just minutes using the Azure command line tool.

You can download the Azure CLI <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">here.</a>

#### Prerequisites:

Some things you'll need before we get started:

* Installed Azure CLI
  
* PWA source repository hosted on GitHub
  
* <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free"> Free Azure account </a>

#### Step by Step

1. Use this command to log in to Azure with the CLI. It will redirect you to the browser to authenticate.

```bash
az login
```

2. Create a resource group with this command.

```bash
az group create --name my-swa-group --location "eastus2"
```

3. For this next step, you will need your GitHub repository URL. Replace the `name`, `app-location` and `source` arguments and run this command

```bash
az staticwebapp create \
    --name <name of your PWA> \
    --resource-group my-swa-group \
    --source <URL to your Github repository> \
    --location "eastus2" \
    --branch main \
    --app-location "<path to your PWA's root>" \
    --login-with-github
```

?> **Note** The `app-location` argument is the root directory of your PWA in the repository. If your PWA lives at the top level of your repo, just use `/`.

4. You will be prompted in the command line to authorize GitHub, follow the link and enter the provided code.

5. Run a query command to find your PWA's URL.

```
az staticwebapp show --name random-pwa --query "defaultHostname"
```

6. That's it, your PWA can be found at that URL. If your static web app didn't deploy properly, check out the `Actions` tab on your GitHub repository for possible errors.

#### Next Steps

You can trigger a new deployment of your PWA by commiting to the branch that your GitHub Action is associated with. Check the `Actions` tab for status of recent deployments.

## Github Pages

!> Built-in support for Github Pages was added to the Starter in June 2022. If you cloned the starter template before then, deploying to GitHub pages may not work by default.

Another quick and easy option for deploying your PWA is Github Pages. 

The Starter has a built in Workflow that will build your PWA for GitHub Pages entirely on the cloud, no pushing or pulling to the repo is necessary.

#### Prerequisites

Some things youâ€™ll need before we get started:

- Github account

- Personal version of the PWA Starter hosted on Github

#### Building For Deployment

First, let's bundle and build your PWA for deployment:

1. Go to your PWA's repository on GitHub.

2. Click the `Actions` tab.

3. Under `Workflows`, select `Deploy PWA Starter to GitHub Pages`.

4. Click `Run Workflow`

5. Wait for your build to complete. This should only take 1-2 minutes.

</div>

#### Enabling GitHub Pages

Once you have run the workflow, you can enable GitHub pages to display your site:

1. Go to the `Settings` tab in your PWA's repository.

2. Navigate to the `Pages` subsection.

3. Under `Source`, select `gh-pages` as your branch and `/ (root)` as your directory.

4. Click `Save`.
   
5. Your PWA will deploy to your personal Pages site!

     <img src="/assets/starter/publishing/enable-pages.png" alt="Image showing how to enable GitHub Pages on your repository." width=650>
</div>

#### Next Steps

You can trigger a new deployment by repeating the steps done in the ***Building for Deployment*** subsection.

If you want to set up automatic deployments, navigate to your `.github/workflows/main.yml` file and add this snippet on line 5:

```yml
push:
  branches:
    - main
```

This enables the *push* trigger for your workflow. Anytime you push to main, the workflow will be triggered.
