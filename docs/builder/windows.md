# Publishing PWAs to the Microsoft Store

You can use PWABuilder to build application packages that are submittable the Microsoft Store. Once you have your packages through PWABuilder, you'll need to go through the <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us"> Microsoft Partner Center </a> to create your app submission.

#### How does it work?

The PWABuilder service creates both a `.msixbundle` and a `.classic.appxbundle`. 

The `.msixbundle` is the compatible
package type for newer versions of Windows while `.classic.appxbundle` works with older versions.

## Prerequisites
There are some boxes you'll need to check before your PWA is ready to be published to the Microsoft Store.

- A valid PWA with a web manifest, published to the web and secured through HTTPS

- A Microsoft Developer account (which are available for a one-time fee of $19)

## Reserve Your App

In order to create a proper package of your PWA, you'll first need to reserve a name for your application in the Microsoft Partner Center. This will also allow you to get package info that's required for PWABuilder:

1. Log in to the <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/home"> Partner Center Dashboard </a>

2. Navigate to the `Apps and Games` section.
   
3. Click the `+ New Product` button and select `App`.

4. You'll be prompted to reserve a name for your application submission.

5. Once you have reserved your name, you will be able to access your package info. Navigate to the `Product Identity` section and take note of these three values:
