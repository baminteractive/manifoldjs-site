# Customizing Your Web Manifest

Many capabilities of progressive web apps are exposed through your app's web manifest, and you can use the PWABuilder service to edit your manifest and enhance your app.


To edit your manifest via the PWABuilder site:

1. Get to your app's report card page. If you need guidance on this, vist the [Quick Start.](/builder/quick-start)

2. In the `Manifest` subsection, click `Edit Your Manifest`.

3. A modal with several tabs will open. Each tab will contain different settings for editing your manifest, along with brief tooltips on what each field means.

4. Once you've edited your manifest to your liking, you can either download your manifest with the `Download Manifest` button at the bottom of the modal, or copy-paste it from the `Code` tab on the far right.

If you want more in depth documentation on manifest fields, full descriptions for each field follow below. They are separated into the sections they appear in on the PWABuilder website.
