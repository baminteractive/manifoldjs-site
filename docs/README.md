## PWA Starter 

The PWA Starter is our opinionated and production tested starter that the PWABuilder team uses to build all of our PWAs, including PWABuilder itself. 

The PWA Starter uses a lightweight, fast, and extensible stack that allows you to quickly get started with developing a new PWA. 

It comes with the key pieces of any PWA, including a manifest and service worker functionality through [Workbox.](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)

To learn more about the starter's tech stack and how to develop on it, take a look at the [quick start.](/starter/quick-start)

## PWABuilder Studio

PWABuilder Studio is an extension for Visual Studio Code that provides tooling for working with and creating progressive web apps.

You can use PWABuilder Studio to:

* Create a new PWA using the starter template
  
* Convert an existing web app into a PWA
  
* Manage your appâ€™s manifest, service workers, and icons
  
* Package your apps for the Microsoft, Google, and Apple Stores
  
* Validate your PWA across several metrics
  
* Add web capabilities with code snippets

## PWABuilder

[PWABuilder.com](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) is the hallmark tool within the PWABuilder suite. 

PWABuilder enables developers to quickly and easily to generate store uploadable packages for the Microsoft, Google Play, and iOS App stores. 

In addition to store-ready packages, you can also generate side-loadable packages for testing and validation.
